@nytimes Honestly can y'all stop having opinions thanks.
@nytimes Delete this shameful article NYT, it's like it was written by a Trump/rapist apologist. Disgrace of writing
@nytimes This is fun because up to now, we've only had men with questionable pasts complaining that it's just a bit of flirting but now we can have a woman disingenuously writing off endemic sexism in the name of feminism! Progress!
@nytimes Awful on many levels, but let's begin with the author speaking for feminists and other women instead of for herself.
@nytimes This is a HORRIBLE article! It seems to want " the good old days" when abuse was swept under the rug, and women were told "that's just life".  NO! That's abuse and a crime. As a mother and grandmother, I applaud the women coming forward.
@nytimes Jealous of the people who are saying they saw pop-ups instead of this article
@nytimes This is a shit take on many points. For starters, men, as a cohort, make women the victims by dictionary definition, then tell us we are buying into a victim mentality when we speak up and say it is wrong. Women can't win. I know women more eloquent than rebut this piece.
@nytimes Sounds like the real problem is the author's shitty friends.   Weird how many people who lie about what they think and feel are so confident everyone else must be performing too. https://t.co/hKqCrruv7h

@CHSommers We were raised by the baby boomers so.. https://t.co/6U0EyUAgsy
@CHSommers My parents are Gen X and they taught me how to be a good person, to work hard because nothing is free, to always look over my shoulder because everyone is crazy, and most importantly that other people don't define me. So why don't you just mind your own business old woman.
@CHSommers We are having much better sex than you have ever dreamed of because we value consent.
@CHSommers It's kinda tough since sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll all have mandatory minimum sentences attached to them now thanks to your generation.
@CHSommers Funny, as a genX'er I remember growing up seeing large amounts of mccarthyism, the pointless war on drugs, satanic panic, moral wars on sexual freedom, and large amounts of discrimination against anyone not straight white male.
@CHSommers A bit too busy trying not to get shot down at public school, but thanks anyway.

@CHSommers I say this as someone STILL annoyed about that early 90's TIME magazine article (came out before the term "Gen x" was even a thing) saying we were all terrible because we weren't doing what boomers thought we should. Give it a rest &amp; let Millennials do things their way.
@CHSommers As a card carrying member of Gen X I am so tired of seeing people shit on Millennials. The Millennials I know ARE hard working, intelligent, and out there organising for social change. Why do boomers have to critique every generation not their own? You did it with mine 1st.
@sarahchad_ @realsaramerica I'm in awe of your ability to stand up and be counted right now. Keep fighting! We're with you.
Women are often told to avoid "weak" language like "I think," but the truth is it's often more accurate. I find it more troubling when people state their opinion as if it's an undisputed fact.  We don't need to fix women; we need to appreciate what they're already doing.
@SarahJoyAdams @sarahchad_ Yes! And make sure all of your friends who are old enough are registered to vote. We already know we can't count on current Congress to do anything.

The reactions to the Parkland student survivors speaking out for gun control reminds me so hard of the overwhelming condescension we feel for teenagers and we need to stop.  They know what happened to them, they know how they feel about it, and they know what they want to say.
